<!-- JWT (Authentication): -->

Securely authenticate users and protect routes.
<!-- Mongoose (Database): -->

Interact with MongoDB to store and retrieve user data (e.g., registration details, posts).
<!-- Multer (File Uploads): -->

Handle uploading and saving user files like profile pictures.
<!-- CORS (Cross-Origin Requests): -->
When a client from one domain tries to access a resource on another domain, the browser performs a CORS check. If the server does not allow that origin, the request is blocked.
Allow your front-end (e.g., React or Angular) to interact with the back-end API. -->
